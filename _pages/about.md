<div style="text-align: justify; word-wrap: break-word;"> I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Graduate Center, City University of New York(CUNY), and an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Computer Science, Queens College, CUNY. Before joining CUNY, I was a graduate student at the School of Computing and Information Sciences, Florida International University. I received my M.Phil degree from the Department of Computer Science, Graduate Center, CUNY, in 2022, and my B.S. degree from the Faculty of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, in 2016. My research interests lie in the domain of distributed machine learning, with a specific focus on the theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of coding techniques. My work aims to address the challenges and opportunities in deploying coding methods to effectively bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications in the field. </div>
